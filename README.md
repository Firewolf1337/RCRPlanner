# ❗❗ 16. Oct. 2024: iRacing has changed thir Login system. They have enabled OAUTH which at the moment won't allow 3rd party applications to login by default. To get 3rd party applications like this back to work you have to enable "legacy authentication".❗❗

# Ravencreekracing Planner (RCRPlanner) for iRacing
I have developed this planner to make decisions easier which tracks I should purchase for the season.
This got a bit out of hand and this planner is now a bit more, than originally planned. 
Now you can see all series, cars, tracks and upcoming races for in iRacing.
You can automatically start applications which you need while racing and close them together with the planner.
In addition, it is possible to create some interesting statistics.
